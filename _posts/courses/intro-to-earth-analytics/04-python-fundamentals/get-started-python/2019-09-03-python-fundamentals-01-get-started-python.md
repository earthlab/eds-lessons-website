## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Chapter Ten - Get Started with Python

In this chapter, you will learn what makes `Python` a useful programming language for scientific workflows. You will get started with writing `Python` code to create variables and lists to store information (i.e. data) and run basic operations on them (e.g. updates, comparisons). You will also learn about the PEP 8 Style Guide for `Python`, which provides useful standards for naming conventions and organization of code to support readibility.


## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

* List key characteristics and benefits of using the `Python` language for scientific workflows.
* Explain how variables and lists are used in Python to store data.
* Write Python code to create variables and lists and run basic operations on them (e.g. updates, comparisons).
* Implement key ideas of the PEP 8 Style Guide to your `Python` code.
