This lesson reviews best practices associated with clean coding.



<div class='notice--success' markdown="1">



## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

At the end of this activity, you will be able to:



* write code using the PEP 8 style guide



## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need



You need `Python 3.x` and `Jupyter notebooks` to complete this tutorial. Also you should have an `earth-analytics` directory setup on your computer with a `/data` directory with it.

### Resources

* <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank" data-proofer-ignore=''>PEP 8 Python Style Guide</a>



</div>


Clean code means that your code is organized in a way that is easy for you and for someone else to follow / read. Certain conventions are suggested to make code easier to read. For example, many guides suggest the use of a space after a comment. Like so:


```python

#poorly formatted  comments are missing the space after the pound sign.

# good comments have a space after the pound sign

```

While these types of guidelines may seem unimportant when you first begin to code, after a while you're realize that consistently formatted code is much easier for your eye to scan and quickly understand.



## Consistent, Clean Code

Take some time to review <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank" data-proofer-ignore=''>PEP 8 Python Style Guide</a>. From here on in, we will follow this guide for all of the assignments in this class.



## Object Naming Best Practices

1. **Keep object names short:** this makes them easier to read when scanning through code.

2. **Use meaningful names:** For example: `precip` is a more useful name that tells us something about the object compared to `x`

3. **Don't start names with numbers!** Objects that start with a number are NOT VALID in `Python`.

4. **Avoid names that are existing functions in Python:** e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, see [here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keywords-identifier) for more reserved names.



A few other notes about object names in `Python`:

* `Python` is case sensitive (e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`).
* Avoid other function names (e.g. `mean`,).
* Use nouns for variable names, and verbs for function names.
* Avoid using dots in object names - e.g. `my.dataset` - dots have a special meaning in R (for methods) and other programming languages. Instead use underscores `my_dataset`.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Challenge

Take a look at the code below.

* Create a list of all of the things that could be improved to make the code easier to read / work with.
* Add to that list things that don't fit the PEP 8 style guide standards.
* Try to run the code in `Python`. Any issues?


<!--

FORMAT Issues:
* missing spaces in between comments
* comments aren't useful to help me understand what is happening



Object Naming Issues
* didn't use useful object names that describe the object
* one very long object name
* used a mixture of underscore and case that will be easy to confused
