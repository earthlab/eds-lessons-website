## Why Use GitHub For Science Collaboration?

In the previous chapter, you learned about **git** and **GitHub**. Recall that **git** is a
tool that can be used to manage version control for various files. **GitHub** is a
website that runs git behind the scenes. The **GitHub** website also has additional
functionality that extends the functionality of **git**. This functionality allows
you to manage projects, coordinate with others on updates to code, text files
and other files in your repo. GitHub also facilitates sharing your code with the
world (OR with specific people if you'd prefer to work with a smaller group of people privately).

In the next few lessons, you will learn more about the various GitHub tools that you
can use to collaborate on projects.

## GitHub For Project Management and Collaboration

There are several tools that GitHub offers that support collaborating on projects.

### 1. GitHub Pull Requests

The pull request is a way that you or a colleague can suggest code changes. The pull request allows
   * your collaborators to see exactly what items were changed line by line in the code.
   * A group of people working on the code to view, review and comment on the code line by line.

The pull request is a great way to ensure that everyone is on the same page with your edits before the changes are merged or combined into a designated repository. Pull Requests are specific to the GitHub platform.

TODO: <FIGURE -- image showing a pull request with some changes suggested? perhaps just a text file or something simple>

### 2. GitHub Issues

Issues in GitHub are ways to document and discuss changes needed in a repository.
Issues are normally text (and code) that describe something that needs to be
addressed. An issue could be related to something that needs to be fixed in your
code or text. Issues can be assigned to one or more people to work on which
makes them useful for project management. You can keep track of who is working
on what items in the repository. You can also link issues to Pull Requests
discussed above. Linking issues to Pull Requests is good practice and will be
discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

There are other project management tools within GitHub that you can also use to
manage your project as it becomes more complex.

### 3. GitHub Project Milestones

If you have a large project, you can create milestones which can be used to
group sets of issues together that are related.

TODO: screen shot of milestones

### 4. Github Project Management Tools

You can also use **GitHub** to manage an entire project or set of projects. You can 
setup boards similar to a tool like Trello to manage pull requests and milestones,
who is working on what and associated deadlines. For the time being the **GitHub**
project management tools will not be discussed in this textbook.

> TODO: Link to the actual project management tools so they can see how they work. Add a few screen shots.
> TODO Put together an overview of what a pull request workflow looks like. add graphics.
